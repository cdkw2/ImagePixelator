# Pixel Art Image Generator

The pixel art image generator is a Python program that allows users to create monochrome pixel art from any input image. The program works by resizing the input image to a user-specified resolution and then converting each pixel in the resized image to a corresponding square in the output image. The output image is displayed in the console or saved as a file in PNG format. The program can be customized to adjust the size of the output image and the color of the squares, and can be used to create a wide range of pixel art designs from any input image.
